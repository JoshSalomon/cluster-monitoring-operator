== NodeExporterCollectorProcessesConfig

=== Description

The `NodeExporterCollectorProcessesConfig` resource works as an on/off switch for the `processes` collector of the `node-exporter` agent. If enabled, these metrics become available: `node_processes_max_processes`, `node_processes_pids`, `node_processes_state`, `node_processes_threads`, `node_processes_threads_state`. The metric `node_processes_state` and `node_processes_threads_state` can have up to 5 series each, depending on the state of the processes and threads. The possible states of a process or a thread are: 'D' (UNINTERRUPTABLE_SLEEP), 'R' (RUNNING & RUNNABLE), 'S' (INTERRRUPTABLE_SLEEP), 'T' (STOPPED), 'Z' (ZOMBIE). By default, the `processes` collector is disabled.
