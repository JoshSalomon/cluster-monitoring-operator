| Property | Type | Description 
|enabled|bool|When `enabled` is set to `true`, the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) deploys a dedicated Service Monitor that exposes the kubelet `/metrics/resource` endpoint. This Service Monitor sets `honorTimestamps: true` and only keeps metrics that are relevant for the pod resource queries of Prometheus Adapter. Additionally, Prometheus Adapter is configured to use these dedicated metrics. Overall, this feature improves the consistency of Prometheus Adapter-based CPU usage measurements used by, for example, the `oc adm top pod` command or the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
